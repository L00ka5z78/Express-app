# Express-app

App with login authentication, news where you can search articles. Quiz where you can vote on your favorit season of the year.
Home page, admin page and mongoDb cloud databes. 

Tech stack I used:
  - JavaScript
  - Express.js
  - pug,
  - mongoose,
  - git/gutHub to upload and commit code.
  
 On the positive side:
  1.App works.
  2. Splitted code in different files and directories, to avoid large ammounts of code in one file/place.
  
 On the negative side:
  1. Styling is poor, but it was not my main focus.
  2. Date format when you add articles is not as I wanted to be. Cant figure it out, why..
  
  A little information about app.
  There is a home page, with menu where you have some options.
  Login as an admin, search engine, quiz and news.
  As an admin you can add articles to news feed, and search them with simple search engine.
  News are sorted ascending by date.
  Every time you add articles it is added to mongoDb database.
  Quiz includes one question, where you can vote. Vote results shows as an answer, and percentage.
  It is added to mongoDb too.
